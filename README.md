# Merger

A Kustomize generator plugin to merge YAML files seamlessly for real-world use cases.

## Why

**The main goal of the `Merger` plugin is to provide a more flexible way to merge YAML files
and extend the strict merge capacities of Kustomize.**

Kustomize's default patch strategy for the lists (arrays) is `replace`, and to change that
for the Kubernetes `Custom Resource`, you must provide the OpenAPI schema of that custom resource,
which is only helpful if the lists of that CR have a unique id.

For more details, please read:
[Set OpenAPI patch strategy for Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://tech.aabouzaid.com/2022/11/set-openapi-patch-strategy-for-kubernetes-custom-resources-kustomize.html).


## Features

- Generate multiple resources/manifests from a single base without copying the resources multiple times.
- Merge any manifests (even CustomResources) without needing their OpenAPI schema.
- Merge manifests with a list of maps without a unique identifier (when using `x-kubernetes-patch-merge-key` is not possible).
- Merge YAML files with different merge strategies (StrategicMerge).
- Merge applications configuration YAML files into a ConfigMap or Secret (WIP).


## Options

```yaml
---
apiVersion: generators.kustomize.aabouzaid.com/v1alpha1
kind: Merger
metadata:
  name: merge
spec:
  resources:
  - name: example
    input:
      # Available options: overlay,patch.
      # - Overlay: Produce multiple outputs by merging each source with the destination.
      # - Patch: Produce a single output by merging all sources together then with the destination.
      method: overlay
      files:
        sources:
        - src01.yaml
        - src02.yaml
        destination: dst.yaml
    merge:
      # Available options: replace,append,combine.
      # - Replace: All keys in source will merge and replace what's in the destination.
      # - Append: Maps from source merged with destination, but the lists will be appended from source to destination.
      # - Combine: Maps from source merged with destination, but the lists will be combined together.
      strategy: combine
    output:
      # Available options: raw.
      format: raw
```


## Use cases

This section shows a couple of use cases where Merger can help.

### 1. Generate multiple manifests from a single base

In this case, you have multiple `CronJobs`, all of them share the same body, but each one has a different command or other config.

[Use case full example](./examples/generate-multiple-manifests/README.md).

### 2. Merge lists in manifests without schema or a unique identifier

Currently, in Kustomize, it's not possible to merge resources without a unique identifier, even with Open API schema.

It's possible to do that using the merge strategy `append` in Merger (later on, `combine` will also be supported).

[Use case full example](./examples/merge-lists-without-schema/README.md).

### 3. Structure long manifests into smaller ones

In some use cases (e.g., [Crossplane Compositions](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/compositions/)),
you could have a long YAML manifest, and it's hard to read through it. You can split that file
and use the Merger `patch` input method to make it a single manifest again.

[Use case full example](./examples/structure-long-manifests/README.md).


## TODO

- Support `ConfigMap` or `Secret` as an output.
- Support `combine` merge strategy with an identifier key (similar to `x-kubernetes-patch-merge-key`).


## Project status

Please note that this project is still under development and could be breaking changes,
but it will follow the SemVer convention.
